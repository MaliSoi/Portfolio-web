        <p> Web Redesign & Blog Revamp.<br>
          <b>The Integrity Game (TIG)</b> is a unique platform where coaches offer services focused
          on fostering personal and team growth in soft skills, alongside educational programs, licensing, and
          individual coaching, among other services.
          My role involved a comprehensive redesign of the entire website and blog to enhance its
          usability, visual appeal, and engagement, with a strong emphasis on refining the user experience and front-end
          presentation.

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>The main objective was to balance educational content with playful aesthetics, ensuring a cohesive design
          that clearly guided users through the platform's offerings. This involved meticulously aligning every design
          decision with The Integrity Game's core values of integrity, transparency, and inclusivity, while maintaining
          clear calls to action (CTAs) and coherent user journeys throughout the entire site to support the business's
          overarching goals.</p>

    <section class="project-process">
      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p>The redesign of the entire website was a multi-stage process, meticulously executed to ensure the final product
        met all objectives. It began with an in-depth <b>audit of the existing website</b> to identify areas for
        improvement
        and establish key challenges. This initial phase also included thorough competitor research and analysis to
        understand market standards and opportunities.

        Following this, the focus shifted to structural planning, involving the creation of <b>low and mid-fidelity
          sketches and wireframes</b>, along with a detailed <b>sitemap and user flow development</b>. These steps were
        crucial for
        understanding and optimizing user navigation and the overall site architecture.

        Our methodology was highly collaborative, centered around <b>weekly meetings</b> where progress was consistently
        reviewed. These sessions included the business owner, the marketing team, copywriters, a podcast producer, and
        other key team members. Each meeting served as a forum to present advancements, receive feedback on specific
        areas, and collectively plan next steps, fostering a dynamic and transparent working environment.</p>

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>I found a way to combine my UX/UI knowledge with what I’ve been learning about front-end and web development.
        The goal was simple: to build a clean and functional portfolio that could reflect both sides of me as a
        designer.</p>

    <section class="project-learnings">
      <h2>Outcomes & Learnings</h2>
      <p>I learned that it's incredibly satisfying to work when every team member is genuinely committed to doing their
        part and collaborating with others, understanding that each role contributes to the business as a whole, and
        that all of them are important and interconnected.
        I also learned that in UX/UI, not every step is necessary for every business — or rather, not every deliverable
        is essential for every project. It's important to adapt to each business, its timing, its team members, and
        above all, the deadlines.</p>
